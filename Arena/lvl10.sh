#1. Creates a directory called Arena_Boss.
#2. Creates 5 text files inside the directory, named file1.txt to file5.txt.
#3. Generates a random number of lines (between 10 and 20) in each file.
#4. Sorts these files by their size and displays the list.
#5. Checks if any of the files contain the word 'Victory', and if found, moves the file to a directory called Victory_Archive.
